CASA MeasurementSet data tables can be created using a convenient helper script `mvftoms.py` available from `katdal` installation.     
Measurement sets can be downloaded directly from the MeerKAT archive using some sensible defaults when created.     
Examples on how to create measurement sets from a user control environment using tokens from the archive are given in example notebooks in the utils folder.
